# Modelling Overview

## Environmental Modelling

The following environmental modelling inputs are common across all ecological models, providing the foundation for environmental forcings that inform ecological responses on the Great Barrier Reef.

- **eReefs suite**: Modelling environmental drivers and pressures on Tthe Great Barrier Reef. 

- **RECOM**: Modelling environmental drivers and pressures on the Great Barrier Reef at higher resolutions.

- **OceanParcels**: Modelling particle movement at reef cluster scale to calculate coral larval connectivity.  

- **SWAN**: Modelling wave dynamics to inform coral wave stress estimates. 

- **Global Climate Models**: Sea Surface Temperature Projections from the sixth phase of climate models (CMIP6) to forecast possible trajectories of the Great Barrier Reef under different climate scenarios.

## Ecological Modelling

The following models make up the ecological component of the M&DS modelling suite. Our models provide reef cluster and regional spatial scale dynamic representations of the Great Barrier Reef to help inform decision support processes and systems.

- **ADRIAmod**: Modelling of coral dynamics at regional and reef cluster spatial scale for scenario exploration. 

- **CoCoNet**: Modelling of coral metapopulations at a regional spatial scale. 

- **C~scape**: Modelling of coral dynamics at a reef-cluster and reef site spatial scaleâ€‹.

- **ReefMod**: Modelling of coral metapopulations at a regional spatial scale.
