# C~scape

C-scape is a modeling framework specifically designed to integrate information about the key processes that exhibit variability within coral reefs and exert an impact on the growth of coral populations. Its purpose is to forecast the dynamics of coral populations across reef complexes. C-scape's adaptability extends to either a solitary reef or a cluster of small reefs covering a selected geographic region, typically spanning from 10 to 40 kilometers in width.
