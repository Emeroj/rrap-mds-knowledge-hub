# C~Scape

C~scape captures key processes that vary within reefs. It links coral colony growth and survival to population-level responses and to physical and environmental spatial layers, creating a seascape of coral populations. The coral life cycle informed by demographic data is the engine for coral growth. It allows mechanistic investigation of interventions that influence different coral life stages. This ecological information can inform effective intervention deployments within reef clustersâ€‹
