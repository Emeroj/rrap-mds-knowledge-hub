# Model Evaluation & Validation Process

The ecological and environmental models run within the M&DS suite are at different stages of development with respect to model evaluation. 

A working group has been established to develop an overall framework for evaluation of model fitness for purpose in the context of long-term intervention planning.


## Environmental Modelling

Evaluation of the GBR-scale eReefs marine models has been extensively documented in eReefs 
technical reports and journal papers (Skerratt et al., 2019; Robson et al., 2020). 

Evaluation of RECOM models for reef clusters has commenced, using EcoRRAP monitoring data including temperature and local-scale current monitoring data.

Evaluation of larval connectivity OceanParcels modelling has been conducted at some sites using a range of approaches, including tracer and recruitment studies (Doropolous & Roff, 2022).

## Ecological Modelling

At the reef cluster scale, C~scape uses long term monitoring data from the Moore reef cluster to validate model outputs. 

At the regional scale CoCoNet uses Long Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) data collected by AIMS, to calibrate and refine the model, improving alignment with the counterfactual results, in relation to both coral cover and CoTS densities.
