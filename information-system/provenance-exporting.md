## Overview

To assist in M&DS's ability to report on modelling activities, the [Provena](./index.md) information system has been extended to generate regular CSV reports of modelling activities. 

These CSV reports are automatically generated and stored securely each day.

### Accessing Provenance Reports

You should talk to your system maintainer and request access to the reports. For now, this will be on a case-by-case basis, but if regular reporting becomes a priority please feel free to raise this issue and regular delivery or direct user access can be considered.
