# Register model run records by CSV Templates

## Overview

The Provenance Store user interface facilitates the registration of provence through the filling out of CSV templates. These CSV templates are autogenerated from Model Run Workflow Template entities defined in the entity registry.

- Explain this method for registrating provenance

## Where to do this

This tooling can be found by clicking on the "Provenance Registration Tools" button from the Provenance Stores home page.

## How to register Provenance by CSV

### Obtaining a CSV template
The first step is to obtain a CSV template for you to fill out. The templates are autogenerated from Model Run Workflow Template entities in the registry, so begin by registrating one of these in the registry. See here for help

Upon successfully creating a Model Run Workflow Template in the Registry Entity, you should be able to search for it by name or ID within the Provenance Registration Tool by navigating to the "Generate CSV Template" side tab. When you have found it, select "click to download" located at the bottom of the tool box.

### Using the CSV template
Opening the template in excel, we can see the fields to be filled in listed across the top as headers. Each row that is filled in corresponds to a single Model Run.
Any fields beginning with underscores ("_") are automatically filled in by the Information System, so these columns must not be manually filled in. The default required fields required by us for you to fill in are discussed below. In addition to these, you may have specified more fields in the definition of the template in the registry entity that will also appear as headers.

**Description**: A brief description of the Model Run.
**Agent ID**: The ID of agent responsible for running the model run. This is the ID of the person in the Registry entity. To obtain an ID for a person, first try searching for them in the registry, if they don't exist, they will need to be registered to create an ID for them.

**Requesting Organisation ID**: The ID of the organisation requesting the Model Run. Again, this ID refers to the ID of the organisation in the Entity Registry. To obtain an ID for an organisation, try searching for them first, if they don't exist, they will need to be registered to create an ID for them.

**Execution Start/End Time**: The respective start and end time of the model run execution. The format for these a profile of ISO8601 in which a space is allowed to seperate the date and time. Additionally, the IS will also accept "/" for the date section, and will allow for the timezone and seconds/minutes to be ommitted. If the timezone is ommitted, UTC will be assumed by the system. If seconds, minutes, hours are ommitted, the IS will record 00 for there value. E.g. inputting 2022-11-28 12:23 will go be assumed to equal 2022-11-28 12:23:00+00:00.

Some example formats (for which a 'T' can also be used to seperate the date and time):
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+HH:MM
- YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS+HH:MM
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
- YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
- YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM


**Dataset ID for Template XXXXX.X/XXXXXXX**: This refers to the ID of the Dataset that conforms to the templates specified for the input/output of this model run. (TODO: are these only inputs?)
