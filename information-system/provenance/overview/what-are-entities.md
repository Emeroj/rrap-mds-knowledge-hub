# What are entities?

In the RRAP M&DS Information System (IS), entities are things that are registered in the M&DS IS Registry. Registering entities is fundamental to establishing stable provenance. 

Each registered item (entity) is given a unique and persistent identifier (ID). These IDs provide a mechanism for 2 things:
1. It allows information to be attached to each entity in a defined way
2. Entities are able to link to other entities (i.e. object references rather than just text descriptions)

These registered things can then be referred to in provenance records, e.g. a provenance record about a model run is able to link to defined descriptions of the model that was used, who ran the model, a list of input data, and the outputs/results. The ability to link to entities reduced manual error and duplication of descriptions, as they can be reused and simply referred to. Registering provenance records with the entity references provides a way to create provenance graphs. These provenance graphs can then be queried.
