## User Roles
Currently users will need to select **Roles** to be able to perform tasks.  Select **Roles** under your user menu item (silhouette of a person) from the top right of page. From the **Roles** page users can request levels of access (read only, read and write, administration) to particular parts of the system

|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Data Store | data-store-read  |   read only |
|   | data-store-write  | write |

| ____  | ____  | ____ |
| Handle Service  | handle-service-read  |   read only |
|   | handle-service-write  |  write |
|   | handle-service-admin  |   admin |
