## User Roles
Currently users will need to select **Roles** to be able to perform tasks. Once you are on the RRAP M&DS IS [landing page](https://rrap-is.com){:target="\_blank"} select **Roles** under your user menu item (silhouette of a person) from the top right of page. From the **Roles** page users can request levels of access (read only, read and write, administration) to particular parts of the system

|                      Application                       |         Role         |                         Access Level                          |

|                                                        |   data-store-write   | write/generate new dataset records and uploading to the store |
|                                                        |   data-store-admin   |         administration, adding and removing users etc         |
| [**Handle Service**](../digital-object-identifiers.md){:target="\_blank"} | handle-service-read  |                           read only                           |
|                                                        | handle-service-write |    write, modifying old and adding new handle identifiers     |
|                                                        | handle-service-admin |                             admin                             |
