## User Roles
Currently users will need to select roles to be able to perform tasks.  Select 'Roles' under your user menu item (silhouette of a person) from the top right of page. From the 'Roles' page users can request levels of access (read only, read and write, administration) to particular parts of the system

We are intending to identify users without roles applied and provide a 'Welcome' page with further instructions to requests roles.
