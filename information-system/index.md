# Information System

The RRAP M&DS Information System is based on Provena, a cloud-based knowledge management system that enables users to register, manage and publish knowledge artifacts used and generated within a scientific or modelling workflows.<br>

{% include notes.html content = "The steps shown in the Provena documentation are the same as the RRAP M&DS Information System, the only difference is that the colours used in the screen shots will be different to those appearing on the users screen when logged into the M&DS IS." %}

All other features should be the same, if this is not the case please contact us.
