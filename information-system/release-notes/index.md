#  Release notes

The Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP) Modelling and Decision Support (MDS) Information System (IS) was initially developed as a bespoke platform. Since version 1.4, the MDS IS has been generalised into a successor product called Provena (v1.0) (See http://provena.io and the Provena Github Repo at https://github.com/provena/provena). 

Updates to the MDS IS will be based on new versions of Provena. For details of releases and new features/updates, please refer to the release notes for Provena at https://github.com/provena/provena/releases.
