## What is dataset lock?

Datasets in the datastore can be locked to prevent any changes from being made to the dataset's data or metadata until it is unlocked. Dataset locks can be applied/removed by users who have administration access privileges to the dataset. 

## How to dataset lock

A dataset can be locked by dataset administrators by first navigating to the dataset in the datastore. From there, click on the "settings" tab, then open the "lock settings" drop down, then select "Lock Dataset". This feature is only visible to those with dataset admin privileges.
