Once you are logged into the RRAP M&DS Data Store, you can search for a dataset by entering information, such as the dataset name, in the **Search Dataset** field and clicking the magnifying glass button.
You can also click the **Browse datasets** link located under the *Find out more* menu.

You are then taken to the Datasets page.  
On this page, you can quickly filter datasets by organisation by selecting the check boxes beside each name. Once you have found the dataset you are looking for, click on the dataset name and you will be taken to the dataset's metadata page.

The metadata page has the Handle and storage location for the dataset on the left hand side.
On the right hand side you can get dataset information, [download the dataset](../data-store/downloading-datasets.html) and [upload additional data](../data-store/registering-and-uploading-a-dataset.html) by clicking the corresponding tabs.
