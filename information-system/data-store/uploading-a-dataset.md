## Overview of the process

The diagram below outlines the steps undertaken when registering and uploading a dataset.  
_Note: draft figure_

![Workflow diagram](../../assets/images/DRAFTv2_upload_data.png)
_A User logs into the RRAP information system & selects DATASTORE then REGISTER DATASET from the website. A metadata form prefilled with the Userâ€™s name & email address opens and the User fills out information relating to the data being uploaded (see [Filling out form fields](#filling-out-form-fields){:target="\_blank"} for more detailed information). After the metadata form is completed the User uploads the dataset by one of these [methods](#how-do-i-upload-dataset-files){:target="\_blank"}, depending on the size of the file(s). The data is assigned its own unique PID (Persistent Identifier). The data is securely stored on an AWS S3 server, ready for future reference and usage._

## Uploading dataset files

{% include notes.html content="You will require a set of RRAP-IS AWS credentials to be able to upload data to the AWS S3 data store.  See details on the dataset metadata page obtaining AWS credentials." %}

Dataset files can be uploaded once the metadata record is created. Users can choose between using a GUI or command line. The AWS web console (GUI) can be used for files/folders up to 5GB in size. Larger files should be uploaded using a program like WinSCP or the AWS CLI v2.

### Uploading data via AWS Web Console (small to medium files)
Click on the **Upload data** tab.


Request credentials by clicking the **Request Credentials** button.

Next, open the link to AWS system, by either clicking on the **Click to open storage location** button or the link in the text. Users will then be taken to the AWS S3 bucket location which will house the dataset files. The associated metadata record will be seen as a ro-create-meatadata.json file.
