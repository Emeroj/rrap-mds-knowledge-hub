## Overview 

Dataset accessibility can be managed by contorlling what the general datastore user can do with the dataset, and by contorlling which groups can access a dataset, and the extent of their access. This documentation will discuss the latter.

The group access feature enables custom permission for groups (and their memebers) to a dataset. This facilitates the privatisation of datasets to only certain users of the information system.

This documentation will discus the creation of groups and the setting of configuration of their individsual privilidges. 

## Creating a group

Group creation is currently performed only by information system administrators. Please get in touch and we facilitate this for you.
