## Overview 

Dataset access control is achieved through group only access, and/or by controlling what the general datastore user can access. This documentation will discuss the latter. 

There are three access rights to consider. 
1. Metadata access 
2. Data access
3. Admin access


## Where to change access control

Access control can be updated once a dataset has been registered by navigating to the 'settings' tab in the view of the dataset.
In future version of the IS, the ability to control access prior to initial publishing will be implemented. For now, a workaround is to register a dataset with meaningless metadata, update access privileges, then updating the metadata
