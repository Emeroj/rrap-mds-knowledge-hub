All datasets that are inputs or outputs for operational products must be registered and stored on the RRAP information system. It is expected that (but not essential) that the registration and storage will occur concurrently. The metadata required for each dataset is to be determined during workshop by the sub-program teams. It is expected that metadata will consist of 3 types of information:

- Disciplinary (science) based metadata which will describe aspects of the data relevant to the research community.
- Program based metadata containing key information from a program perspective.
- Provenance metadata which will most likely include a unique identifier for the dataset, and a reference to the identifier of the process used to generate the dataset.
