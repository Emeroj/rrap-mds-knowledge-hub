# Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program Modelling and Decision Support (M&DS) Knowledge Hub

The Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP) is a collaboration of Australia’s leading experts to create a suite of innovative and targeted measures to help preserve and restore the Great Barrier Reef. These interventions must have strong potential for positive impact, be socially- and culturally-acceptable, ecologically-sound, ethical and financially responsible. They would be implemented if, when and where it is decided action is needed – and only after rigorous assessment and testing.

### What is M&DS and its role?
The M&DS knowledge hub was set up to support decision makers, RRAP R&D Sub-program Leads, RRAP Steering Committee and Board members, Reef managers and industry partners to co-produce objectives, options & knowledge and communicate informed decisions on restoration and adaption options for the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program.
