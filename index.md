# Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program Information System (RRAP-IS) Knowledge Hub
Welcome to the RRAP-IS Knowledge Hub, is site serves as a central place for user documentation that supports the use of RRAP-IS and its components.

## RRAP-IS overview
The Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP) is a collaboration of Australia’s leading experts to create a suite of innovative and targeted measures to help preserve and restore the Great Barrier Reef. These interventions must have strong potential for positive impact, be socially- and culturally-acceptable, ecologically-sound, ethical and financially responsible. They would be implemented if, when and where it is decided action is needed – and only after rigorous assessment and testing.

The RRAP M&DS IS aims to facilitate:

- Data and information capture and access, 
- Information to support management decisions in RRAPflows between modelling and decision support teams
- The provision of information 

RRAP M&DS IS seeks to provide components to enable improved knowledge framework for catalogue, understand and re-use knowledge within RRAP, and in particular, in the supporting management decisions for RRAP.
