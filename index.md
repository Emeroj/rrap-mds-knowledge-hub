# Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program Modelling and Decision Support (M&DS) Knowledge Hub

The Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP) is a collaboration of Australia’s leading experts to create a suite of innovative and targeted measures to help preserve and restore the Great Barrier Reef. 

These interventions will have positive impact, be socially and culturally acceptable, ecologically-sound, ethical and financially responsible. 

They would be implemented if, when and where it is decided action is needed – and only after rigorous assessment and testing.

### Modelling and Decision Support subprogram

The Modelling and Decision Support (M&DS) subprogram was set up to support decision makers, RRAP R&D subprogram Leads, RRAP Steering Committee and Board members, Reef managers and industry partners to co-produce objectives, options & knowledge and communicate informed decisions on restoration and adaption options that may be used as part of the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program.

The primary objective of the M&DS subprogram is to develop an operational suite of models and decision-support processes and systems that:
1. produces forecasts of reef conditions and values for the Great Barrier Reef under different climate change 
scenarios & traditional management systems,
2. enables insights into intervention solutions that can deliver robust outcomes against multiple 
objectives in space and time under uncertainty, constraints, and limited resource, and 
3. supports informed strategic and tactical intervention decision-making and management planning for the Great Barrier Reef, people and industries.
