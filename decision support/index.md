# Decision Support 
This section describes the M&DS suite capability to support strategic and tactical decision making on the Great Barrier Reef. The purpose of this capability is not to make decisions, rather it is to provide best practice guidance to decision makers on decision processes and use of decision support systems to maximise decision quality.
