# Decision Support Overview

Decision Support Processes are the processes by which decisions are framed, choices are identified, developed and logically analysed for their consequences and trade-offs, and commitments to action are made, across the decision landscape (Sivapalan et al., 2020).

A Decision support system (DSS) is a computerised system that gathers data from identified sources, synthesises it, and makes it available to users in accordance with specified decision processes to support quality decision making on specific semi-structured and unstructured decision problems. 

A DSS includes the following features, as outlined in further detail in the 2020 GBR Decision Support System Scoping Report (Sivapalan et al., 2020):
- Data Base 
- Database Management System
- Database GUI
- Model Base
- Model Base Management System 
- Model base GUI
- Decision GUI

There has been significant collaboration and progress on the path to an effective support of decision makers and execution of decision-making processes.
