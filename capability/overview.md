## Our Mission

Our Mission is to help environmental decision makers on the Great Barrier Reef explore and identify robust intervention options under uncertainty. We do this using integrated state-of-the-art environmental, ecological and economic models and decision-support tools.


## Our Capability

Our modelling and decision-support (M&DS) suite is a unique synthesis of environmental, ecological, and economic models with information systems and decision-support processes and systems (tools). The M&DS suite is designed to help decision makers explore benefits, costs and risks of new and existing interventions under uncertainty.​

We use the best scientific knowledge of global and regional environmental forcing in space and time, and the biological and ecological responses of corals, to inform actions that can sustain a resilient Reef in the face of climate change. ​

We translate ecological information to value functions and through scenario analyses of outcomes, identify intervention options that represent viable and lasting economic and social outcomes for the Great Barrier Reef and peoples. ​

The M&DS suite informs strategic and tactical Reef intervention decisions at scale through the following capabilities: 

- [**Reef Characterisation and Selection**](./reef-charact-select/){:target="\_blank"}: Regional and reef-cluster characterisation and selection for intervention deployment. 
- [**Reef Counterfactuals**](./counterfactuals/){:target="\_blank"}: Modelling of potential futures for The Reef under uncertainty.
- [**Reef Interventions**](./intervention-modelling/){:target="\_blank"}: Characterisation of the effect of interventions on The Reef.

For recent advancements across the M&DS capability see [**Advancements**](/rrap-mds-knowledge-hub/advancements/){:target="\_blank"}
